                       New assingnment  : project 1 ( 'guess the number' GAME )

 PROG 1 : Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a
                   number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100, or any range. Then give users
                 a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses wrong, 
                 he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. 
                   
                *The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller
                 , or a combination of all.
              


SOLUTION:-


import random
import math
# Taking Inputs
lower = int(input("Enter Lower bound:- "))

# Taking Inputs
upper = int(input("Enter Upper bound:- "))

# generating random number between
# the lower and upper
x = random.randint(lower, upper)
print("\n\tYou've only ",
	round(math.log(upper - lower + 1, 2)),
	" chances to guess the integer!\n")

# Initializing the number of guesses.
count = 0

# for calculation of minimum number of
# guesses depends upon range
while count < math.log(upper - lower + 1, 2):
	count += 1

	# taking guessing number as input
	guess = int(input("Guess a number:- "))

	# Condition testing
	if x == guess:
		print("Congratulations you did it in ",
			count, " try")
		# Once guessed, loop will break
		break
	elif x > guess:
		print("You guessed too small!")
	elif x < guess:
		print("You Guessed too high!")

# If Guessing is more than required guesses,
# shows this output.
if count >= math.log(upper - lower + 1, 2):
	print("\nThe number is %d" % x)
	print("\tBetter Luck Next time!")
